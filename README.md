# CFD Data - DMD

This folder contains files to process 2D CFD simulation data from the [dataset](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/G5MNYF).

## Description

- Download the `test_data_1.e` and `train_data.e` from the dataset.
- Use `preprocessing.py` script to get the processed data

    ```bash
    python preprocessing.py input_file_name output_file_name
    ```

- Have fun with the `dmd_test.py` file but remember that these functions are used in preprocessing. So make changes at your own discretion.
